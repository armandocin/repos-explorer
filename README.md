### Deliverable

You are tasked with building a React application that allows users to search for GitHub repositories by keyword using the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28). The application should display a list of matching repositories with basic information, support pagination, and allow users to view detailed information about any selected repository. Focus on clean code, good API handling, and user experience.

Keep the commit history clean and linear, using your preferred branching technique for merging different features.

_You are encouraged to use Gen AI tools to build your solution, it's important you understand the strengths and potential weaknesses of the logic you implement._

Remember to create a README.md file with the steps to deploy the application locally.
